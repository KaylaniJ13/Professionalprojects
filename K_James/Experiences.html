<p>During my junior year of high school, I was offered an internship from Tech Sassy Girlz for the duration of my spring break during Covid in their Pearls in Tech program. I was incredibly grateful and excited to learn to code even though I had no experience and barely knew what it was. As the internship began, I quickly began fascinated by the daily teachings twice a day by women who recently completed their degree in STEM. It opened my eyes for the first time to programming languages and ever since then I have been fascinated by coding. By the end, of the spring break week I had created a mockup of my very own first webpage.</p>

    <h2> My Concentrations</h2>
	<p> As shown above, this very internship during high school has influenced while also lead me to where I am now. The very small introduction of HTML and CSS helped me figure out what I wanted to study in college. This also influenced the concentrations I picked for my major Information Technology which are "Data Mining" and "Web Development". </p>
