  <caption> Short Biography </caption>
      <p>A biography can have exciting approaches and be told or written in many ways, which is why every biography is unique to that person. This is the very concept that I would like to use to describe myself because often, my life takes exciting approaches, but I am a unique person. I am Kaylani James, a short, curly-headed girl with a light complexion. In my country or background, they would call me a “shabin” or “coolie,” but in America, I am light skin. My personality is driven by my culture, which derives from a country named Saint Lucia in the West Indies. A Caribbean girl who is afraid to talk most times and doesn’t come off friendly, but when comfortable, is the life of the party. </p>
 
      <p>If you see me walking without my phone in my hand or hearing me sing a song, please be aware that something is wrong or I’ve lost it. My anxiety drives me insane constantly to the point where I avoid human interaction and look at my phone. Although, the power of music overwhelms everything in me and return, produces a voice that everyone loves to hear. Whether it be an R&B song from the 2000s to a rap or afrobeat song from the present day, know I’m singing it. My stubbornness continues as it allows me to fight for anything I truly believe. My books create a fantasy world that will enable me to live a life that the campus hasn’t begun yet. </p>
 
      <p>As a summer B student, I made my lifelong college best friend, who is not my roommate anymore but someone that made me a better person. She was the person I went to the cafe the first time with, and I learned about the campus and parts of Tallahassee. Although I am still trying to put myself out there and break out of my shell, if someone could give me a chance and get to know me, you will always see my heart of gold. Or, visit my love for technology through games because I can go on about all types and how I always win or try to. Ultimately, I’m a determined, motivated person who always loves to crack a joke behind the crowd.</p>
